* About the Project 
===================  
iCertify is a web-based application that provides recommendations for the apt Certification providers to the buyers with different service requests. It mainly focuses on Australian and New Zealand (NZ) businesses who need certifications to certify that their business processes and products meet Australian or NZ Standards. It allows the businesses to spend comparatively less hours when sourcing the right certification provider. The web application enables the Service providers to register and maintain their data to the website in order to provide their information about their company, certifications and services they provide, pricing etc. It also helps the buyers to lodge a service request and get matched with the apt certification providers for the certificate that the buyer is interested in.   
The following points are the main objectives of the project to be met by the development team:  
->Implementation of an iconic system with a focus on customers interaction and engagement: Providing a streamlined approach to the searching process of service providers for the Australian and/or NZ businesses (buyers). The project requires the creation of a website than an application. The purpose is to attract more users, as website could be used on any device like laptops, PCs, tablets, and mobile phones (iOS and android) whereas the applications could only be used on an android mobile (if the app is android based) or iPhones and tablets (if the app is iOS based). The introduction of this website will be a replacement of the manual process of gathering information about the service providers and the preferences of the buyers while requesting a service, which is currently performed by the auditor.  
 ->Build a smarter adaptable system for a more productive business: The company data on this website will be easily accessible only to the verified users when they require it. The admin/auditor will be able to gather and view the information for both service providers and the buyers in the market at one place. The product will help in time reduction for the administrator who spends on researching for the appropriate service providers in terms of the services they provider, their address, number of employees etc. For different service requests.

* The main feature that the team was asked to be focused on are:  
====================================================== 
1 - Service Provider Registration and Credentials Setup: service providers can register with the iCertify website by storing their organisation information and the details about the services they provide. In order to easily update their information stored in the system, they need to set up a login Email and a password as their credentials to later log into the iCertify website.  
2 - Service Request: this feature will be a form where buyers will fill in their information and the preferences for various services they require, like what certificates they are looking for, address where the service is required, when the service is required etc. 
3 - Service Provider Login and Forget Password: service provider can log into the system in order to update their organization and pricing information they have been verified by the admin at iCertify. If the service provider forgets password or wishes to change their password credential, the service provider will be able to click on the forgotten password then enter the registered email. An OTP (One Time Password) will be sent to the registered email. The service provider will be required to verify the OTP. Once verified the service provider will be able to set a new password.  
4 - Verification & Matching process: the admin gets access to the service providers’ information and the service requests' information so that the person can verify their details and update the database. Once the service providers are verified, they can then log into the system. After buyers put in their service request, the admin uses their information to match them up with the most suitable providers that match their preferences and then send an email to both the parties with options to accept the matched identities. Once the buyer and service provider accept each other, the admin runs the formal documentation process manually.
